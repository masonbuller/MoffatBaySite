<h1>Moffat Bay Website using Java, Bootstrap, MySQL, and Tomcat</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Project consists of a site that was built using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JSP, and runs using Java servlets and TomCat.</p>
<p>This project was done as a final capstone project for my Bachelor's degree. Our task was to build a lodging website. We were able to choose however we wanted to build it, and I chose Java and Tomcat because we have used that in previous classes. Bootstrap was used for most of the responsive design on the website. JSP files were used to write the HTML and include custom error message banners at the top of each page. CSS was used for any styling not covered by Bootstrap. All data was stored using a MySQL database. User passwords are stored in a request variable, then hashed before they are saved in the database. Java servlets were used for the backend. I used servlet mapping and post/get methods to connect the frontend and the backend. Maven was used for creating a pom.xml file for the library dependencies. Finally, Tomcat was used to run the website.</p>
